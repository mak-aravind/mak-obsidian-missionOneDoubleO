 - [ ] Date: 01-Mar-23 | Time: 16:35 
	- [ ] Develop a obsidian based project plan for - adoption of Frappe to build : Database centric, distributed and cloud native applications.  
		 The project named as **missionOneDoubleO**. [WIP] 
	- [ ] **Ask Hari** for Agile Project Managment Tool.
		- [ ] Validate OpenProject. [[OpenProject-TODO]]
		- [ ] No need to repeat the task entries for tracking [[Backlog(02-Mar-2023 to 15-Mar-2023)]] [HIGH]
	- [ ] **Ask Hari** whether he had subscribed for ERPNext cloud Version. This will help to refer the functionality that we are going to implement as local version.
		- [ ] Start with https://www.cloudclusters.io/cloud/erpnext/ for 7 days of trail [HIGH]
		- [ ] If trail is satisfying then continue with Monthly paid subscription of plan: **Express Plan for ERPNext**
	- [ ] **Ask Hari** for github official account. Preferably gitlab official account[HIGH]
		- [ ] Cloud clusters provide hosting for [gitlab](https://www.cloudclusters.io/cloud/gitlab/)
		- [ ] Ask the available employees to learn git, if they are not expert.
		- [ ] Do you afford to pay for GitKraken?
	- [ ] **Ask Hari** for email account [HIGH]
	- [ ] **Ask Hari** for Laptop. [LOW]
	- [ ] **Ask Hari** for Monitor.[MEDIUM]
	- [ ] Confirm with Hari  for below approach :
		- [ ] Biz road map [agreed but double confirm]
			- [ ] flow through: 
				1. Evaluate ERPNext ---> 
				2. Adopt ERPNext for in-house ---> 
				3. Idea-ate a basic [NEEDY] application to develop.
			- [ ] Follow up:
				- [ ]  If road map confirmed prepare the Gantt chart with tentative timelines for Biz road map. [Mohan/Hari todo]
		- [ ] Technology road map [explain why](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext)  [backtracking](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker) is the best approach
			- [ ] flow through:
				1. Install dockerized "open project" locally --->
				2. Quickly evaluate open project ---> [Mark this project as potential capability to set right the delivery process??] -----> [[Dev-And-Release-Process]]
				3. Follow the same strategy to run the containerized ERPNext ---> [if biz satisfied go to setp 4].
				4. Install Frappe ---> 
				5. Build a basic [NEEDY] application on Frappe ---> 
				6. With the understanding of application we built on Frappe, implement the existing ERPNext as local version ---> 
				7. Containerize local code base as application ---> 
				8. Integrate an existing extension with ERPNext to bring in added-potential-value [payment gateway].
				9. Orchestrate the dockerized application using k8s for 12 factor app.--->[[Outset-Frappe-Bench]]

				- [ ] If roadmap confirmed prepare the Gantt chart with tentative timelines for tech road map. [Mohan/Hari/Aravind todo]
